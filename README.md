# Digital-Wallet
A digital wallet for keeping track of trusted transactions

NOTE:
The paymo_input folder is filled with short ~10-line example lists of transactions. The ./run.sh script successfully implements the 3 features on these small files. GitHub did not allow the larger files. Since it's impossible to push the main batch_payment.txt and stream_payment.txt files to GitHub, you will need to replace these two files with the actual versions locally.
